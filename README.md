# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Simple-Linear-Regression-
Regerssion Analysis- it is the method of modelling relationships between variables.
The variable we want to predict is called the target variable/outcome/dependent variable
The variable we are using to predict the dependent variable is called independent variable.
Simple Linear Regression is where one variable is used to predict the outcome of the dependent variable(target variable).

Based on the score of prediction(0.4), we can conclude that the regression model used is not suitable for this kind of data. Linear regression is good for predicting things that can be any number (like predicting someone's height or the price of a house). But our "Diabetes Progress Score" is only ever 0 or 1.
